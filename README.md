# Smart-Railway-QR-Android
This app is part of my major project 'Smart Railway Ticket Booking and Authentication System'. In this, the passenger can generate a QR Code(after booking the train ticket) along with registering their fingerprint using the android app which will contain his PNR number. At the time of boarding the train, the passenger has to get the QR code and fingerprint scanned(using the same app and biometric scanner), which will send a signal to the arduino(connected to the app via bluetooth) to open the coach gates. The app also tracks the location of passenger in realtime on Firebase.
